Place your image assets here.

Required files (exact names):
- assets/images/logo_orizzontale.png  (recommended ~600x120, transparent PNG)
- assets/images/logo_quadrato.png     (recommended 512x512, square PNG)

After adding the images:
1) flutter pub get
2) flutter clean (optional if cache persists)
3) flutter run

If the files are missing, the app will show graceful fallbacks instead of crashing or overflowing the layout.
